This is a maze solver app which uses breadth first search as algorithm to find the shortest path in the maze (you can move up/down/left/right).
You can create the maze (obstacles by yourself) or generate it randomly.
You can visualize the use of algorithm and see how it finds the path.
The order of the process should be like this:
1. Create the obstacles by yourself -> Press the button "Obstacles" and left click on the interface 2 times and let it pressed and move it where you want to create or create them randomly -> Press the button "Random".
2. In case you want to delete some of those blocks -> Press the button "Erase" and use the same steps as with "Obstacles".
3. Set the location from where you want to start -> Press the button "Location" and the left click on a cell.
4. Set the destination where you want to get -> Press the button "Destination" and left click on a cell.
5. You can choose from finding the path -> Press the button "Find path" and it will give you the path if it's possible or you can visualize it and also see the path -> Press the button "Visualize" and you will see the bfs algorithm.
6. Clear the interface -> Press the button "Clear" to make it clean.
